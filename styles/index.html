		Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. 
		In the past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of 
		writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, 
		with new lines appearing one under the other.

		 The @container CSS at-rule is a conditional group rule that applies styles to a containment context. 
		 Style declarations are filtered by a condition and applied to the container if the condition is true. 
		 The condition is evaluated when the container changes size.
		 An optional case-sensitive container-name can be provided which filters the set of query containers considered to just those with a matching query container name. 
		 Once an eligible query container has been selected for an element, each container feature in the <container-condition> is evaluated against that query container.

		While we can add a margin to the float to push the text away, 
		we can't add a margin to the text to move it away from the float. 
		This is because a floated element is taken out of normal flow and the boxes of the following items actually run behind the float. 
		You can see this by making some changes to your example.
		Add a class of special to the first paragraph of text, the one immediately following the floated box, 
		then in your CSS add the following rules. These will give our following paragraph a background color.

		When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. 
		Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; 
		without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch. 
		All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way.

		An object like this is referred to as an object literal â€” we've literally written out the object contents as we've come to create it. 
		This is different compared to objects instantiated from classes, which we'll look at later on.
		It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, 
		related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database. 
		Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, 
		and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

		The first thing the worker does is start listening for messages from the main script. It does this using addEventListener(), which is a global function in a worker. 
		Inside the message event handler, the data property of the event contains a copy of the argument passed from the main script. 
		If the main script passed the generate command, we call generatePrimes(), passing in the quota value from the message event.
